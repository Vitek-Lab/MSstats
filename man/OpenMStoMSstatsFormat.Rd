OpenMStoMSstatsFormat(
  input,
  annotation = NULL,
  useUniquePeptide = TRUE,
  removeFewMeasurements = TRUE,
  removeProtein_with1Feature = FALSE,
  summaryforMultipleRows = max,
  use_log_file = TRUE,
  append = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{name of MSstats input report from OpenMS, which includes feature(peptide ion)-level data.}

\item{annotation}{name of 'annotation.txt' data which includes Condition, BioReplicate, Run. 
Run should be the same as filename.}

\item{useUniquePeptide}{TRUE (default) removes peptides that are assigned for more than one proteins. 
We assume to use unique peptide for each protein.}

\item{removeFewMeasurements}{TRUE (default) will remove the features that have 1 or 2 measurements across runs.}

\item{removeProtein_with1Feature}{TRUE will remove the proteins which have only 1 feature, which is the combination of peptide, precursor charge, fragment and charge. FALSE is default.}

\item{summaryforMultipleRows}{max(default) or sum - when there are multiple measurements for certain feature and certain run, use highest or sum of multiple intensities.}

\item{use_log_file}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing
will be saved to a file.}

\item{append}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing will be added
to an existing log file.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing wil be printed
to the console.}

\item{log_file_path}{character. Path to a file to which information about 
data processing will be saved. 
If not provided, such a file will be created automatically.
If `append = TRUE`, has to be a valid path to a file.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to `data.table::fread`.}
}
\value{
data.frame in the MSstats required format.
