## Nature Protocols Workflow

This markdown document reviews the workflow from the upcoming MSstats Nature 
Protocols paper. First we will review a simple workflow with classic MSstats, 
then an updated workflow with MSstatsBig.


## Classic `MSstats` Workflow

**Note: you must have at least 32GB of RAM to run this workflow**

First we load the data and packages

```{r cars}
library(MSstats)
library(tidyverse)

fragpipe_data = read.csv("msstats.csv")
```
