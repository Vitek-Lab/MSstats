CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.12
-------------------------
- remove vignetter folder to remove install and build error in Bioconductor

CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.9
-------------------------
- dataProcess 
	- add options for ‘cutoffCensored=“minFeatureNRun”’.
	- summaryMethods=“TMP” : output will have ‘more50missing’column.
	- remove50missing=FALSE option : remove runs which has more than 50% of missing measurement. It will be affected for TMP, with censored option.
	- MBimpute : impute censored by survival model (AFT) with cutoff censored value
	- featureSubset option : “all”,”top3”, “highQuality”
	- change the default.
-groupComparisonPlots
	- heatmap, for logBase=10, fix the bug for setting breaks.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.8
-------------------------
- dataProcess : when censoredInt=“0”, intensity=0 works even though skylineReport=FALSE.
- dataProcess, with censored=“0” or “NA” : fix the bug for certain run has completely missing.
- cutoffCensored=“minRun” or “minFeature” : cutoff for each Run or each feature is little less (99%) than minimum abundance.

-summaryMethod=“TMP”, censored works. censoredInt=NA or 0, and cutoffCensored=0, minFeature, minRun

CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.3
-------------------------
- dataProcess : new option, skylineReport. for skyline MSstats report, there is ‘Truncated’ column. If Truncated==True, remove them. and keep zero value for summaryMethod=“skyline”.
- groupComparison : for skyline option, t.test, val.equal=TRUE, which is no adjustment for degree of freedom, just pooled variance.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.4
-------------------------
- Change the numbering of file name for plots. If the file names are already existing in the folder, automatically next number will be add at the end of file name. Therefore file name will not be overwritten, and we can keep all pdf files for plots.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.3
-------------------------
- fix the groupComparison for label-free experiments.
- automatically generate progress report as .txt files
- add progress message for groupComparison and dataProcessPlots function.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.1
-------------------------
- fix the bug in Condition plot : 
	1. for label-based : match reference and endogenous
	2. for label-free : when there is one observation in each group, SD=NA. make it zero.
- fix the bug in heatmap and comparison plots : remove NA result for plotting
- fix the bug for label-free groupComparison :  how to get subject_nested parameter in make.contrast.free for unequal number per group
- fix the bug in group quantification : make.contrast.group.quantification fixed for subject_nested parameter


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.99.1
-------------------------
- fixed several NOTES, added .Rbuildignore, compacted vignettes
- TODO: check remaining 'no visible binding for global variable' NOTES
- removed warn -1 
- added validity check when returning MSnSet
- used inherits/is. for class testing
- TODO fix if conditions syntax

 o fix bug for groupComparison : when there are missing values in endogenous intensities, but values in reference intensities, .make.constast.based or .free sub function were changed. <2013-07-25>

o two function for transformation between required input for MSstats and MSnSet class <2013-09-04>
o flexibility for visualization : save as pdf files or show in window with selected proteins or all proteins. <2013-09-04>
o handle unequal variance for feature in groupComparison function with featureVar=TRUE <2013-09-04>

o Add 'missing.action' for impute missing values in group comparison stage. <2013-09-20>
