        \item change the default for blimp in dataProcessPlots for profile plot and QC plot. The upper limit of y-axis with ylimUp=FALSE is calculated by maximum log2(intensity) across all proteins after normalization + 3 and then rounding off to the nearest integer.

                \item MissingPercentage : number of measured intensities/ total number of intensities (which is the number of features * the number of runs in a protein) in the conditions used for comparison (from ‘Label’ column) by protein. Therefore different comparisons(Label in the output) from the same protein can have the different percentage of missingness.
                \item ImputationPercentage : number of imputed intensities/total number of intensities in the conditions used for comparison (from ‘Label’ column) by protein. Therefore different comparisons(Label in the output) from the same protein can have the different percentage of imputation.
